
(Note : This is a simple instruction to run the application in virtual python version) )
1.Ctk doesn't work on latest version of python 3.13. Ensure you are using python 3.12 or lower.
   1.1) If you need to run the appliction on virtual python version without uninstalling the latest version follow the below steps.
          -Install python 3.10(for wide support) on official site.
          -Add the installed python to the environment variable. (win+x->system->advanced system settings->environment variables->system variables->path->edit->new->paste the path of python)
          -check you have two python versions , one is your latest version and other is the one you just installed.
               -open cmd and run the below command
                      -> where python 
               -it will show like this: 
                            C:\Users\sivap>where python
                            C:\Users\sivap\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe
                            C:\Users\sivap\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe  
          -Once you have two python versions, open new terminal on VScode and run the below command
               -> py -3.10 -m venv venv (this will create a virtual environment in the current directory)
               -> .\venv\Scripts\activate     
               -> python --version (To ensure it works on python 3.10)
          -Now you can run the application on this virtual environment.Just follow the below steps
               -> pip install -r requirements.txt
               -> change .env file to provide important credentials.(username and password of yours)
               -> paste the database.sql file commands in your Mysql.
               -> python main.py

(Note : Works only in python 3.12 or lower)
2.open vscode and open new terminal. Run the below command
       -> pip install -r requirements.txt
       -> change .env file to provide important credentials.(username and password of yours)
       -> paste the database.sql file commands in your Mysql.
       -> python main.py
